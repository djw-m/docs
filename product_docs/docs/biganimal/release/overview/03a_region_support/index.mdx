## Supported AWS regions 

When using AWS, you can create clusters in the following regions:

| Geographical region |       Cloud region       |   Short name   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| NA                  | Canada (Central)         | ca-central-1   |

| APAC                | Asia Pacific (Sydney)    | ap-southeast-2 |




## Next steps

To successfully deploy a cluster, you must activate the region to prepare its cloud infrastructure. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.

!!! Tip
    You can select a cloud region for deploying your cluster even if it is not yet *Active*. However, your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the cluster is created only after you activate the region.
